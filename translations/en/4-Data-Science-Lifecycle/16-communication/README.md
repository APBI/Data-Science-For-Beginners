# Introduction

### What is Communication?
Let’s begin this lesson by defining communication. **To communicate is to share or exchange information.** This information can include ideas, thoughts, feelings, messages, signals, data—anything that a **_sender_** (someone sharing information) wants a **_receiver_** (someone receiving information) to understand. In this lesson, we’ll refer to senders as communicators and receivers as the audience.

### Data Communication & Storytelling
When communicating, the goal is to share or exchange information. However, when communicating data, the goal isn’t just to pass along numbers. Instead, the aim is to tell a story informed by your data—effective data communication and storytelling go hand-in-hand. Your audience is more likely to remember a story than a set of numbers. Later in this lesson, we’ll explore ways to use storytelling to communicate your data more effectively.

### Types of Communication
This lesson will cover two types of communication: One-Way Communication and Two-Way Communication.

**One-way communication** occurs when a sender shares information with a receiver without expecting feedback or a response. Examples include mass emails, news broadcasts, or TV commercials. In these cases, the sender’s goal is simply to deliver information, not to engage in an exchange.

**Two-way communication** involves all parties acting as both senders and receivers. A sender shares information, and the receiver provides feedback or a response. This is the type of communication we typically associate with conversations—whether in person, over the phone, via social media, or through text messages.

When communicating data, you may use one-way communication (e.g., presenting at a conference or to a large group where questions aren’t asked immediately) or two-way communication (e.g., persuading stakeholders or convincing a teammate to invest time and effort in a new initiative).

# Effective Communication

### Your Responsibilities as a Communicator
As a communicator, it’s your responsibility to ensure your audience understands the information you want them to take away. When communicating data, your goal isn’t just for your audience to remember numbers—it’s for them to grasp a story informed by your data. A skilled data communicator is also a skilled storyteller.

How do you tell a story with data? There are countless ways, but here are six strategies we’ll discuss in this lesson:
1. Understand Your Audience, Your Channel, & Your Communication Method
2. Begin with the End in Mind
3. Approach It Like an Actual Story
4. Use Meaningful Words & Phrases
5. Use Emotion

Each strategy is explained in detail below.

### 1. Understand Your Audience, Your Channel & Your Communication Method
The way you communicate with family members is likely different from how you communicate with friends. You use words and phrases tailored to the people you’re speaking to. The same principle applies when communicating data. Consider who your audience is, their goals, and the context they have regarding the situation you’re explaining.

You can often categorize your audience into one of five groups, as outlined by Dell Executive Strategist Jim Stikeleather in a _Harvard Business Review_ article, “[How to Tell a Story with Data](http://blogs.hbr.org/2013/04/how-to-tell-a-story-with-data/).”

 - **Novice**: First exposure to the subject, but doesn’t want oversimplification.
 - **Generalist**: Familiar with the topic, seeking an overview and major themes.
 - **Managerial**: Requires actionable understanding of details and interrelationships.
 - **Expert**: Prefers exploration and discovery, with less emphasis on storytelling.
 - **Executive**: Focused on significance and conclusions, with limited time.

These categories can guide how you present data to your audience.

Additionally, consider the channel you’re using to communicate—whether it’s a memo, email, meeting, or conference presentation. Your approach should adapt accordingly.

Finally, understand whether you’ll be using one-way or two-way communication. For example:
- If your audience is primarily Novice and you’re using one-way communication, you’ll need to educate them, provide context, and clearly explain your data and its significance.
- If your audience is primarily Managerial and you’re using two-way communication, you can likely skip the context and dive straight into the data. However, you’ll need to manage timing and keep the discussion focused on your story, as questions may arise that could derail the conversation.

### 2. Begin With The End In Mind
Starting with the end in mind means identifying your intended takeaways for your audience before you begin communicating. This helps you craft a coherent story that your audience can follow. This approach works for both one-way and two-way communication.

How do you start with the end in mind? Write down your key takeaways before you begin. As you prepare your story, continually ask yourself, “How does this fit into the story I’m telling?”

Be cautious, though—don’t cherry-pick data. Cherry-picking occurs when a communicator only shares data that supports their point while ignoring other data. If some of your data contradicts your intended takeaways, share it anyway. Be transparent with your audience about why you’re sticking to your story despite conflicting data.

### 3. Approach It Like an Actual Story
Traditional stories follow five phases: Exposition, Rising Action, Climax, Falling Action, and Denouement—or, more simply, Context, Conflict, Climax, Closure, and Conclusion. You can use a similar structure when communicating your data.

Start with context to ensure your audience is on the same page. Introduce the conflict—why did you collect this data? What problem were you trying to solve? Then present the climax—what does the data reveal? What solutions does it suggest? Follow with closure, reiterating the problem and proposed solutions. Finally, conclude by summarizing key takeaways and recommending next steps.

### 4. Use Meaningful Words & Phrases
Vague language can lead to confusion. For example, if you say, “Our users take a long time to onboard onto our platform,” your audience might interpret “long time” differently—some might think an hour, others a week. Instead, say, “Our users take, on average, 3 minutes to sign up and onboard onto our platform.”

Driving clarity is your responsibility as a communicator. If your data or story isn’t clear, your audience will struggle to follow and may not understand your key takeaways.

Use specific, meaningful words and phrases instead of vague ones. For example:
- “We had an *impressive* year!” (How impressive? 2% growth? 50% growth?)
- “Our users’ success rates increased *dramatically*.” (What does “dramatically” mean?)
- “This project will require *significant* effort.” (How much effort is “significant”?)

While vague words can be useful for introductions or summaries, ensure the core of your presentation is clear.

### 5. Use Emotion
Emotion is a powerful tool in storytelling, especially when communicating data. Evoking emotion helps your audience empathize, increases the likelihood they’ll remember your message, and motivates them to take action.

You’ve likely seen this in TV commercials—some use somber tones to highlight serious issues, while others use upbeat emotions to associate their data with positivity.

Here are a few ways to incorporate emotion into your data communication:
- **Testimonials and Personal Stories**: Collect both quantitative and qualitative data, and integrate personal stories to complement your numbers.
- **Imagery**: Use visuals to help your audience connect emotionally with your data.
- **Color**: Different colors evoke different emotions. For example:
  - Blue: Peace and trust
  - Green: Nature and environment
  - Red: Passion and excitement
  - Yellow: Optimism and happiness
  Be mindful that color meanings can vary across cultures.

# Communication Case Study
Emerson is a Product Manager for a mobile app. Emerson notices that customers submit 42% more complaints and bug reports on weekends. Additionally, customers whose complaints go unanswered for more than 48 hours are 32% more likely to rate the app 1 or 2 stars in the app store.

After researching, Emerson identifies two solutions to address the issue. Emerson schedules a 30-minute meeting with the three company leads to present the data and proposed solutions.

The goal of the meeting is to help the company leads understand that the following two solutions can improve the app’s rating, which could lead to higher revenue:

**Solution 1.** Hire customer service reps to work on weekends.

**Solution 2.** Purchase a new customer service ticketing system that allows reps to prioritize complaints based on how long they’ve been in the queue.
In the meeting, Emerson spends 5 minutes explaining why having a low rating on the app store is problematic, 10 minutes discussing the research process and how trends were identified, 10 minutes reviewing recent customer complaints, and the last 5 minutes briefly mentioning two potential solutions.

Was this an effective way for Emerson to communicate during this meeting?

During the meeting, one company lead became fixated on the 10 minutes of customer complaints Emerson presented. After the meeting, these complaints were the only thing this team lead remembered. Another company lead primarily focused on Emerson’s explanation of the research process. The third company lead did recall the solutions Emerson proposed but wasn’t sure how those solutions could be implemented.

In the situation above, it’s clear there was a significant gap between what Emerson intended for the team leads to take away and what they actually took away from the meeting. Below is an alternative approach Emerson could consider.

How could Emerson improve this approach?  
Context, Conflict, Climax, Closure, Conclusion  
**Context** - Emerson could spend the first 5 minutes introducing the overall situation and ensuring the team leads understand how the problems impact key company metrics, such as revenue.

It could be framed like this: "Currently, our app's rating in the app store is 2.5. App store ratings are crucial for App Store Optimization, which affects how many users discover our app in search results and how potential users perceive it. Naturally, the number of users we attract is directly tied to revenue."

**Conflict** Emerson could then dedicate the next 5 minutes to discussing the conflict.

It could be presented like this: “Users submit 42% more complaints and bug reports on weekends. Customers who submit a complaint that remains unanswered for over 48 hours are 32% less likely to rate our app above a 2 in the app store. Improving our app's rating to a 4 would boost visibility by 20-30%, which I estimate could increase revenue by 10%." Emerson should be ready to back up these figures with evidence.

**Climax** After establishing the context and conflict, Emerson could move to the climax for about 5 minutes.

Here, Emerson could introduce the proposed solutions, explain how they address the outlined issues, detail how they could be integrated into current workflows, provide cost estimates, highlight the ROI, and perhaps even share screenshots or wireframes of how the solutions would look in practice. Emerson could also include testimonials from users who experienced delays in complaint resolution and feedback from a current customer service representative about the existing ticketing system.

**Closure** Emerson could then spend 5 minutes summarizing the company’s challenges, revisiting the proposed solutions, and reinforcing why these solutions are the right choice.

**Conclusion** Since this is a meeting with a few stakeholders involving two-way communication, Emerson could allocate 10 minutes for questions to ensure any confusion among the team leads is addressed before the meeting ends.

If Emerson adopted this second approach, it’s much more likely the team leads would leave the meeting with the intended takeaways: that the way complaints and bugs are handled needs improvement, and there are two actionable solutions to make that improvement happen. This approach would be far more effective in communicating the data and the story Emerson wants to convey.
