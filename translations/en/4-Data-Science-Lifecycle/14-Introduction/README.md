## [Pre-Lecture Quiz](https://red-water-0103e7a0f.azurestaticapps.net/quiz/26)

By now, youâ€™ve likely realized that data science is a structured process. This process can be divided into five stages:

- Capturing
- Processing
- Analysis
- Communication
- Maintenance

This lesson focuses on three parts of the lifecycle: capturing, processing, and maintenance.

## Capturing

The first stage of the lifecycle is crucial because the subsequent stages depend on it. It essentially combines two steps: acquiring the data and defining the purpose and problems to be addressed.  
Defining the projectâ€™s goals requires a deeper understanding of the problem or question. First, you need to identify and engage with those who need their problem solved. These could be stakeholders in a business or project sponsors who can help determine who or what will benefit from the project, as well as what they need and why. A well-defined goal should be measurable and quantifiable to establish an acceptable outcome.

Questions a data scientist might ask:
- Has this problem been tackled before? What was discovered?
- Do all involved parties understand the purpose and goal?
- Is there any ambiguity, and how can it be reduced?
- What are the constraints?
- What might the end result look like?
- What resources (time, personnel, computational) are available?

Next, you need to identify, collect, and explore the data required to achieve these defined goals. During the acquisition step, data scientists must also assess the quantity and quality of the data. This involves some data exploration to ensure that the acquired data will support achieving the desired outcome.

Questions a data scientist might ask about the data:
- What data is already available to me?
- Who owns this data?
- What are the privacy concerns?
- Do I have enough data to solve this problem?
- Is the data of sufficient quality for this problem?
- If additional insights are discovered through this data, should the goals be reconsidered or redefined?

## Processing

The processing stage of the lifecycle focuses on uncovering patterns in the data and building models. Some techniques used in this stage rely on statistical methods to identify patterns. For large datasets, this task is typically too time-consuming for humans and requires computers to handle the workload efficiently. This stage is also where data science intersects with machine learning. As you learned in the first lesson, machine learning involves building models to understand the data. Models represent the relationships between variables in the data and help predict outcomes.

Common techniques used in this stage are covered in the ML for Beginners curriculum. Follow the links to learn more about them:

- [Classification](https://github.com/microsoft/ML-For-Beginners/tree/main/4-Classification): Organizing data into categories for more efficient use.
- [Clustering](https://github.com/microsoft/ML-For-Beginners/tree/main/5-Clustering): Grouping data into similar clusters.
- [Regression](https://github.com/microsoft/ML-For-Beginners/tree/main/2-Regression): Identifying relationships between variables to predict or forecast values.

## Maintaining

In the lifecycle diagram, you may notice that maintenance is positioned between capturing and processing. Maintenance is an ongoing process of managing, storing, and securing the data throughout the project and should be considered throughout its entirety.

### Storing Data

Decisions about how and where data is stored can impact storage costs and the performance of data access. These decisions are unlikely to be made solely by a data scientist, but they may influence how the data is handled based on its storage method.

Here are some aspects of modern data storage systems that can affect these decisions:

**On-premise vs off-premise vs public or private cloud**

On-premise refers to hosting and managing data on your own equipment, such as owning a server with hard drives to store the data. Off-premise relies on equipment you donâ€™t own, such as a data center. The public cloud is a popular choice for storing data, requiring no knowledge of how or where the data is stored. Public refers to a shared underlying infrastructure used by all cloud users. Some organizations have strict security policies requiring complete access to the equipment hosting their data and may opt for a private cloud that offers dedicated cloud services. Youâ€™ll learn more about cloud data in [later lessons](https://github.com/microsoft/Data-Science-For-Beginners/tree/main/5-Data-Science-In-Cloud).

**Cold vs hot data**

When training models, you may need more training data. Once satisfied with your model, additional data will arrive for the model to fulfill its purpose. In either case, the cost of storing and accessing data increases as more data accumulates. Separating rarely used data (cold data) from frequently accessed data (hot data) can be a cost-effective storage solution using hardware or software services. Accessing cold data may take longer compared to hot data.

### Managing Data

As you work with data, you may find that some of it needs cleaning using techniques covered in the lesson on [data preparation](https://github.com/microsoft/Data-Science-For-Beginners/tree/main/2-Working-With-Data/08-data-preparation) to build accurate models. When new data arrives, similar techniques will need to be applied to maintain quality consistency. Some projects use automated tools for cleansing, aggregation, and compression before moving the data to its final location. Azure Data Factory is an example of such a tool.

### Securing the Data

A key goal of securing data is ensuring that those working with it control what is collected and how it is used. Keeping data secure involves limiting access to only those who need it, adhering to local laws and regulations, and maintaining ethical standards, as discussed in the [ethics lesson](https://github.com/microsoft/Data-Science-For-Beginners/tree/main/1-Introduction/02-ethics).

Here are some security measures a team might take:
- Ensure all data is encrypted
- Provide customers with information on how their data is used
- Remove data access for individuals who leave the project
- Restrict data modification to specific project members

## ðŸš€ Challenge

There are various versions of the Data Science Lifecycle, where steps may have different names and numbers of stages but include the same processes discussed in this lesson.

Explore the [Team Data Science Process lifecycle](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/data-science-process/lifecycle) and the [Cross-industry standard process for data mining](https://www.datascience-pm.com/crisp-dm-2/). Identify three similarities and differences between the two.

## Review & Self Study

Applying the Data Science Lifecycle involves multiple roles and tasks, with some focusing on specific parts of each stage. The Team Data Science Process provides resources explaining the roles and tasks involved in a project.
