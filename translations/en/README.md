# Data Science for Beginners - A Curriculum

Azure Cloud Advocates at Microsoft are excited to present a 10-week, 20-lesson curriculum focused on Data Science. Each lesson includes pre-lesson and post-lesson quizzes, detailed instructions, solutions, and assignments. This project-based approach ensures you learn effectively by building and applying your skills.

# Getting Started

## 📚 Documentation

- **[Installation Guide](INSTALLATION.md)** - Step-by-step setup instructions for beginners
- **[Usage Guide](USAGE.md)** - Examples and common workflows
- **[Troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md)** - Solutions to common issues
- **[Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)** - How to contribute to this project
- **[For Teachers](for-teachers.md)** - Teaching guidance and classroom resources

## 👨‍🎓 For Students
> **Complete Beginners**: If you're new to data science, start with our [beginner-friendly examples](examples/README.md)! These simple, well-commented examples will help you grasp the basics before diving into the full curriculum.
> **[Students](https://aka.ms/student-page)**: To use this curriculum independently, fork the repository and complete the exercises starting with the pre-lecture quiz. Read the lecture and complete the activities. Try to build the projects by understanding the lessons rather than copying the solution code (available in the /solutions folders for each project-based lesson). Alternatively, form a study group with friends and go through the content together. For further study, we recommend [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/users/jenlooper-2911/collections/qprpajyoy3x0g7?WT.mc_id=academic-77958-bethanycheum).

**Quick Start:**
1. Follow the [Installation Guide](INSTALLATION.md) to set up your environment.
2. Check out the [Usage Guide](USAGE.md) to learn how to navigate the curriculum.
3. Begin with Lesson 1 and progress sequentially.
4. Join our [Discord community](https://aka.ms/ds4beginners/discord) for support.

## 👩‍🏫 For Teachers

> **Teachers**: We've [included suggestions](for-teachers.md) on how to use this curriculum effectively. Share your feedback [in our discussion forum](https://github.com/microsoft/Data-Science-For-Beginners/discussions)!

## Pedagogy
We have selected two key educational principles while designing this curriculum: ensuring it is project-based and includes frequent quizzes. By the end of this series, students will have learned fundamental concepts of data science, including ethical considerations, data preparation, various methods of working with data, data visualization, data analysis, real-world applications of data science, and more.

Additionally, a low-pressure quiz before each class helps students focus on the topic, while a second quiz after class reinforces their learning. This curriculum is designed to be flexible and enjoyable, and can be completed in full or in part. The projects start small and gradually become more complex by the end of the 10-week cycle.

> Check out our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md), and [Translation](TRANSLATIONS.md) guidelines. We welcome your constructive feedback!

## Each lesson includes:

- Optional sketchnote
- Optional supplemental video
- Pre-lesson warmup quiz
- Written lesson
- For project-based lessons, step-by-step guides on how to build the project
- Knowledge checks
- A challenge
- Supplemental reading
- Assignment
- [Post-lesson quiz](https://ff-quizzes.netlify.app/en/)

> **A note about quizzes**: All quizzes are located in the Quiz-App folder, with a total of 40 quizzes, each containing three questions. They are linked within the lessons, but the quiz app can be run locally or deployed to Azure; follow the instructions in the `quiz-app` folder. Localization is ongoing.

## 🎓 Beginner-Friendly Examples

**New to Data Science?** We've created a special [examples directory](examples/README.md) with simple, well-commented code to help you get started:

- 🌟 **Hello World** - Your first data science program
- 📂 **Loading Data** - Learn how to read and explore datasets
- 📊 **Simple Analysis** - Calculate statistics and identify patterns
- 📈 **Basic Visualization** - Create charts and graphs
- 🔬 **Real-World Project** - Complete workflow from start to finish

Each example includes detailed comments explaining every step, making it ideal for absolute beginners!

## GitHub Codespaces

Follow these steps to open this sample in a Codespace:
1. Click the Code drop-down menu and select the Open with Codespaces option.
2. Select + New codespace at the bottom on the pane.
For more info, check out the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/creating-a-codespace-for-a-repository#creating-a-codespace).

## VSCode Remote - Containers
Follow these steps to open this repo in a container using your local machine and VSCode using  the VS Code Remote - Containers extension:

1. If this is your first time using a development container, please ensure your system meets the pre-reqs (i.e. have Docker installed) in [the getting started documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers#_getting-started).

To use this repository, you can either open the repository in an isolated Docker volume:

**Note**: Under the hood, this will use the Remote-Containers: **Clone Repository in Container Volume...** command to clone the source code in a Docker volume instead of the local filesystem. [Volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) are the preferred mechanism for persisting container data.

Or open a locally cloned or downloaded version of the repository:

- Clone this repository to your local filesystem.
- Press F1 and select the **Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...** command.
- Select the cloned copy of this folder, wait for the container to start, and try things out.

## Offline access

You can run this documentation offline by using [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/). Fork this repo, [install Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/quickstart) on your local machine,  then in the root folder of this repo, type `docsify serve`. The website will be served on port 3000 on your localhost: `localhost:3000`.

> Note, notebooks will not be rendered via Docsify, so when you need to run a notebook, do that separately in VS Code running a Python kernel.
