# Data Science for Beginners - A Curriculum

Azure Cloud Advocates at Microsoft are excited to present a 10-week, 20-lesson curriculum all about Data Science. Each lesson includes pre-lesson and post-lesson quizzes, step-by-step instructions, a solution, and an assignment. Our project-based approach helps you learn by doing, which is a proven way to make new skills stick.

# Are you a student?

Get started with these resources:

- [Student Hub page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/student-hub?WT.mc_id=academic-77958-bethanycheum): This page offers beginner resources, student packs, and even ways to get a free certification voucher. Bookmark it and check back regularly, as the content is updated at least monthly.
- [Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors](https://studentambassadors.microsoft.com?WT.mc_id=academic-77958-bethanycheum): Join a global community of student ambassadors‚Äîthis could be your gateway to Microsoft.

# Getting Started

> **Teachers**: We‚Äôve [included some suggestions](for-teachers.md) on how to use this curriculum. We‚Äôd love your feedback [in our discussion forum](https://github.com/microsoft/Data-Science-For-Beginners/discussions)!

> **[Students](https://aka.ms/student-page)**: To use this curriculum independently, fork the entire repository and complete the exercises on your own, starting with the pre-lesson quiz. Then, read the lesson and complete the activities. Try to build the projects by understanding the lessons rather than copying the solution code (though the code is available in the /solutions folders for each project-based lesson). Another idea is to form a study group with friends and go through the content together. For further learning, we recommend [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/users/jenlooper-2911/collections/qprpajyoy3x0g7?WT.mc_id=academic-77958-bethanycheum).

## Pedagogy

We‚Äôve designed this curriculum with two key teaching principles: it‚Äôs project-based and includes frequent quizzes. By the end of this series, students will have learned the basics of data science, including ethical considerations, data preparation, working with data, data visualization, data analysis, real-world applications of data science, and more.

Additionally, a low-stakes quiz before each lesson helps students focus on the topic, while a post-lesson quiz reinforces retention. This curriculum is designed to be flexible and enjoyable, and it can be completed in full or in part. The projects start small and gradually increase in complexity over the 10-week program.
> Find our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md), [Translation](TRANSLATIONS.md) guidelines. We welcome your constructive feedback!
## Each lesson includes:

- Optional sketchnote
- Optional supplemental video
- Pre-lesson warmup quiz
- Written lesson
- For project-based lessons, step-by-step guides on how to build the project
- Knowledge checks
- A challenge
- Supplemental reading
- Assignment
- [Post-lesson quiz](https://ff-quizzes.netlify.app/en/)

> **A note about quizzes**: All quizzes are stored in the Quiz-App folder, with a total of 40 quizzes, each containing three questions. They are linked within the lessons, but the quiz app can be run locally or deployed to Azure; follow the instructions in the `quiz-app` folder. Localization is ongoing.

## GitHub Codespaces

Follow these steps to open this sample in a Codespace:
1. Click the Code drop-down menu and select the Open with Codespaces option.
2. Select + New codespace at the bottom of the pane.
For more info, check out the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/creating-a-codespace-for-a-repository#creating-a-codespace).

## VSCode Remote - Containers

Follow these steps to open this repo in a container using your local machine and VSCode with the VS Code Remote - Containers extension:

1. If this is your first time using a development container, ensure your system meets the prerequisites (e.g., Docker installed) in [the getting started documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers#_getting-started).

To use this repository, you can either open the repository in an isolated Docker volume:

**Note**: This will use the Remote-Containers: **Clone Repository in Container Volume...** command to clone the source code in a Docker volume instead of the local filesystem. [Volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) are the preferred method for persisting container data.

Or open a locally cloned or downloaded version of the repository:

- Clone this repository to your local filesystem.
- Press F1 and select the **Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...** command.
- Select the cloned copy of this folder, wait for the container to start, and try things out.

## Offline access

You can run this documentation offline using [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/). Fork this repo, [install Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/quickstart) on your local machine, then in the root folder of this repo, type `docsify serve`. The website will be served on port 3000 on your localhost: `localhost:3000`.

> Note, notebooks will not be rendered via Docsify, so when you need to run a notebook, do that separately in VS Code running a Python kernel.
